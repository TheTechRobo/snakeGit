A small module for running Git operations...

**Check out [Palc](https://github.com/thetechrobo/python-text-calculator), it's even better than snakeGit**

**NOTE: snakeGit has not finished development yet. Use with caution!**

**NOTE 2: snakeGit is STILL BEING MAINTAINED. It's just not my priority, as I've been pretty busy lately.**

Documentation and details are in the [wiki](https://github.com/thetechrobo/pygit/wiki).
