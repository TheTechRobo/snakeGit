# please suggest to me better PyPI names that pyyGit...sounds like I'm trying to scam people (typo-squatting)

**Check out [Palc](https://github.com/thetechrobo/python-text-calculator), it's even better than pyGit**

**NOTE: pyGit has not finished development yet. Use with caution!**

**NOTE 2: pyGit is STILL BEING MAINTAINED. It's just not my priority, as I've been pretty busy lately.**

Documentation and details are in the [wiki](https://github.com/thetechrobo/pygit/wiki).

# Installing from PyPI
pyGit is on PyPI with the name `pyyGit` (due to another project with the name pyGit). However, you still need to use `import pygit` or `from pygit import *` instead of `import pyygit` or `from pyygit import *`. Because the *package name* is pygit but the PyPI name is pyyGit. I do want a better PyPI name; please suggest one in the Issues section if you want. :D
